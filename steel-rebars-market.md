<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The steel rebars market is primarily divided into two main types: deformed steel and mild steel. Deformed steel rebars feature surface ridges that enhance bonding with concrete, making them ideal for reinforced structures in construction. Mild steel rebars, on the other hand, are smooth and offer greater ductility, suitable for applications requiring flexibility. Both types play crucial roles in construction projects, with deformed steel often preferred for strength, while mild steel is used for non-structural applications.</p></p>
